## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

This is the code to read in the csv file.

```{r}
activity<-read.csv("activity.csv")
```

Mean Total Number of Steps Taken Per Day

```{r}
sum(is.na(activity))
activity_na<-activity[which(!is.na(activity$steps)),]
stepsperday<-tapply(activity_na$steps,activity_na$date,sum)
hist(stepsperday)
mean(stepsperday,na.rm = TRUE)
median(stepsperday,na.rm = TRUE)
```

Average Daily Activity Pattern
```{r}
dailyactivity<-tapply(activity_na$steps,activity_na$interval,mean)
plot(x=names(dailyactivity),y=dailyactivity,type = "l",xlab = "5-Minute Intervals",ylab = "Steps Per Day",main = "Average Number of Step Per Day")
max(dailyactivity)
```

Imputting Missing Values

```{r}
sum(is.na(activity))
newactivity<-activity
newactivity[which(is.na(newactivity$steps)),1]<-dailyactivity[as.character(newactivity[which(is.na(newactivity$steps)),3])]
sum(is.na(newactivity))
newsteps<-tapply(newactivity$steps,newactivity$date,sum)
hist(newsteps)
mean(newsteps)
median(newsteps)
```
The values differ very little. 

Activity Patterns Between Weekdays and Weekends
```{r}
newactivitywd<-newactivity
weekend<-weekdays(as.Date(newactivitywd$date)) %in% c("Saturday","Sunday")
newactivitywd$daytype<-"weekday"
newactivitywd$daytype[weekend==TRUE]<-"weekend"
newactivitywd$daytype<-as.factor(newactivitywd$daytype)
newactivityweekend<-subset(newactivitywd,daytype =  "weekend")
newactivityweekday<-subset(newactivitywd,daytype =  "weekday")
newplotweekend<-tapply(newactivityweekend$steps,newactivityweekend$interval,mean)
newplotweekday<-tapply(newactivityweekday$steps,newactivityweekday$interval,mean)
par(mfrow=c(2,1))
plot(y=newplotweekday,x=names(newplotweekday),type = "l",xlab = "5-Minute Intervals",ylab = "Average Number of Step Taken",main = "The Average Number of Steps Taken Averaged Across All Weekdays")
plot(x=names(newplotweekend),y=newplotweekend,type = "l",xlab = "5-Minute Intervals",ylab = "Average Number of Step Taken",main = "The Average Number of Steps Taken Averaged Across All Weekends")
```
